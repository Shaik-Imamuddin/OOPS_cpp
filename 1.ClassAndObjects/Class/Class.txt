Class is nothing but Blue print or plan
    it is a collection of datamembers and methods 

Syntax:
    class ClassName{
        //datamembers 
        //methods 
    }
    
Terminology will be different in OOP(Object Oriented Programming)

datamembers is nothing but Variables
methods is nothing but Functions

we can create any no.of objects for a single Class

Real Time Example:
let us suppose we are Going to Build a House
First we need to get a plan for that
that paln is nothing bus a Class
By using that Plan we can Build any no.of houses
House is nothing but an Object
object is a real world entity
The plan and requirements before making a real world entity is nothing but class
