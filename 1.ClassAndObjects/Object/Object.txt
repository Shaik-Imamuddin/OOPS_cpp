Object:
object is a real world entity
it is also known as instance of a class
instance is nothing but a way to access the properites of a class

->we can create single object for a class
->we can create Multiple object for a class
->we can create n no.of object for a class
    ->creating n no.of pbjects is nothing but Array of objects

We can create objects in following 2 ways 

mthd-1:

ClassName objectName;

The above Instruction will create a memory in stack
Memory is automatically allocated and deallocated in this case

mthd-2:
Syntax:
    ClassName* objectPtr = new ClassName();

The above Instruction will create a memory in heap

Objects created with new do NOT get deleted automatically.
If not deleted manually, it causes a memory leak.

so it needs manual memory deallocation

Syntax:
    delete objectPtr;
