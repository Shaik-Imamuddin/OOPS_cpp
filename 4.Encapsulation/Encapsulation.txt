Encapsulation:

->Wrapping up the hidden data into a single unit

->covering the hidden data with some other values

->it will be used only with private variable

->we need to declare the variables as private to achieve encapsulation

->we can't Access the private variables in other classes (or) outside of the current class

->but we need the private variables for implementing encapsulation

->There are two ways for Accessing private variables

	->By using Constructors
	->By using getters and setters


in getters and setters we are having 2 methods

->get method
->set method

->get method
	->get method will take the values
	->get method will not have any argument
	->get method will have return type

->set method
	->set method Assign the values
	->set method will have arguments
	->set method will not have any return type
